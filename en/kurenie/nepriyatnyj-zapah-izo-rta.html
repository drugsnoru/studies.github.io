It is no secret that many <b>smokers</b> suffer from <b>bad breath</b> from time to time. Although heavy smokers are most often affected, even those who smoke sporadically may be unsuccessful enough to suffer from bad breath.
<br><br>
Alarmingly, studies show that smokers often experience &quot;impairment of olfactory sensation.&quot; In short, you may not even realize that you are suffering from a smoker’s breath; and if you can smell your own breath, the problem may be much more serious than you think.
<h2>What causes bad breath from smokers?</h2>
<img class="myImage" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/nz1.jpg" alt="Что вызывает неприятный запах изо рта курильщиков?">
<br>
There are three most common causes of breath odor among smokers, although they can often overlap and affect each other.
<h3>Tobacco chemicals</h3>
Not surprisingly, the most immediate cause of &quot;smoker’s odor&quot; is tobacco itself. Not only do the lungs retain some of this tobacco smoke even some time after the cigarette has gone out, but the chemicals remain in the mouth.
<h3>Dry mouth</h3>
<img class="myImage" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/nz2.jpg" alt="Сухость во рту у курильщика">
<br>
A longer-term problem may be exposure to tobacco smoke on bacteria in the mouth. These sulfur-producing bacteria feed on proteins and produce chemicals known as volatile sulfur compounds (or VSCs).
<br><br>
Human saliva has a powerful ability to counteract the activity of oral bacteria due to its pH. This is why many dentists recommend using sugar-free chewing gum after meals, which stimulates saliva flow, thereby helping to fight harmful bacteria.
<br><br>
Smoke inhalation was found to have a &quot;significant correlation&quot; with dry mouth (3), meaning that smoking can lead to the growth of bacteria that cause halitosis.
<br><br>
Dry mouth not only affects breathing but has also been shown to be associated with other dental problems such as gingivitis (edema of the gum line) and tartar formation.
<h2>Oral hygiene problems</h2>
<img class="myImage" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/nz3.jpg" alt="Проблемы гигиены полости рта у курильщика">
<br>
The third and final cause of breath odor in smokers can be (in some cases) related to poor oral hygiene. Studies have shown that smoking is often &quot;associated with higher VSC values&quot;, likely as a result of two previous causes (5).
<br><br>
Persistent dry mouth can lead to tartar, plaque, and other related hygiene problems.
<br><br>
Although many smokers deny that smoking can cause oral health problems, effective oral care is more than just brushing teeth (which we will talk about shortly).
<h2>How to get rid of the smell from the smoker's mouth</h2>
Although the most obvious solution to the problem of bad breath after smoking is to give up this habit, we are well aware of how difficult it can be.
<br><br>
Fortunately, there are a number of other solutions that can be useful to eliminate the smell from the smoker's mouth.
<h2>Bad breath (halitosis)</h2>
<img class="myImage" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/nz4.jpg" alt="Неприятный запах изо рта (галитоз)">
<br>
<b>Halitosis</b>—or bad breath—may result from poor oral hygiene, but it is not always the case. It can also result from a number of health problems, including dry mouth, heartburn, or even disease of another part of the body. Treatment of halitosis depends on the underlying cause.

<h3>What is halitosis?</h3>
Halitosis is a medical term for bad breath. Every once in a while, people have a bad breath, especially after eating garlic, onions, or other spicy foods. But bad breath that doesn't go away (chronic halitosis) can mean that you have oral health problems or a condition that affects another part of the body.
<br><br>
Halitosis is a symptom of many different states. In other words, it's like a warning message from your body. Finding the root cause of halitosis is the first step to treating the problem.
<h3>How common is halitosis?</h3>
<img class="myImage" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/nz5.jpg" alt="Насколько распространен галитоз?">
<br>
Halitosis is common and affects about 1 in 4 people worldwide. One study combining the results of 13 articles in medical journals found that halitosis affected about 31.8% of the population.
<h2>What causes an unpleasant smell </h2>
<img class="myImage" title="Плохой запах изо рта" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

<br>
In the morning, she gently shuffles you aside: &quot;This is not the time to kiss, sweetheart. I'm in a hurry...&quot; Arriving at work, you heard from the doorstep: &quot;Colleague, do you want gum? By the way, I have a dentist I know, I can give you his phone...&quot; And when you were buying oranges at the store, the saleswoman winked mockingly: &quot;Young man, but you still do not want fresh garlic?&quot; No, neither your girlfriend, nor Petrovich from the sales department, nor the saleswoman, were part of a criminal conspiracy to drive you crazy. It's the smell of the mouth. Your mouth. Two middle-aged drunks on the bus.<br>
'Vas, and Vas?'<br>
- What?<br>
'What does your mouth smell like that?'<br>
'I've been bitten in my soul!'
<p>I have to say you're lucky. No, really! It's not easy to find your breath stale. The person usually does not notice odors emanating from the body. So if someone let you know that your mouth smells bad, thank you — you wouldn't have noticed. And don't get upset, it happens to everyone from time to time. In most cases, it takes only brushing your teeth to get rid of bad breath. However, according to dentists, for many (from 10 to 15% of people) it is not so simple - chronic diseases are the cause of stale breathing.</p>
<p>
<strong>One of the main difficulties in treating stale breathing is to help people realize that their mouth smells bad!</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img class="myImage" title="Дурной запах из рта" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/1349634411_von.jpg" alt="Дурной запах из рта" />
<br>
Some people complain about some unpleasant taste in their mouth. They are either embarrassed to talk about their problem, or they just don't know what it is. Breathing infrequently is a very delicate problem. People are very reluctant to admit to themselves that everything is wrong with their mouth. But this can affect the personal life of the sufferer and his career.&quot; However, people often feel bad about their breath, even though everything is in fact fine.</p>
<h2>Why bad breath?</h2>
<p>
<img class="myImage" title="Заболевания ротовой полости" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/1349634408_von-3.jpg" alt="Заболевания ротовой полости" />
<br>
Oral diseases account for 90% of cases of poor breath odor, rather than the commonly believed causes of stomach disease. It is caused by anaerobic bacteria that accumulate between the teeth and gums and in cracks in the tongue. People with gingival disorders most often have poor breath odor. By decomposing the proteins of dead cells and food debris in the mouth, the bacteria secrete sulfur dioxide. The same gas that gives rotten eggs their indescribable &quot;aroma&quot;. Normally, the amount of saliva in the mouth is enough to cope with these bacteria, but during sleep or excessive coffee and alcohol consumption, the body becomes dehydrated. Less saliva is produced, so bacteria do not leach from the mouth. The same thing happens when you talk too long, do hard physical work, or suddenly wake up.</p>
<p>A classic example. One lawyer who doesn't usually eat anything all day. No breakfast or lunch - just coffee. A sea of coffee. The smell from his mouth was terrible - even though he had mori cockroaches. The doctor recommended that he eat at least some fruit for breakfast, and a couple of sandwiches in the middle of the day, things quickly recovered.&quot; In 10% of cases, stale breathing is not associated with oral diseases and is due to more complex medical problems. For example, diabetics are often unaware of their disease but have unhealthy gums. Bad breath can occur in patients with kidney or liver disease.</p>
<h2>How to get rid of breath odor?</h2>
<p>
<img class="myImage" title="Из рта неприятно пахнет" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/1349634374_von-5.jpg" alt="Из рта неприятно пахнет" />
<br>
<strong>We determined the scale of the disaster.</strong>
</p>
<p>You can check the purity of breathing yourself. To do this, point your tongue at the inside of your wrist, wait until the saliva dries, and smell. You can try a more reliable way: take a clean napkin, put it on your tongue as close as possible to the base, take it off, let the saliva dry, and then smell. If it smells like lemon pie (or what was the last time you ate there?) - stop worrying and read another article. If it smells like garbage, read on.</p>
<p>
<strong>See a dentist.</strong>
</p>
<p>It is a sign of a civilized person to visit a dentist regularly. You walk into the office and you say, &quot;Tell me, doctor, do I smell?&quot; Go to the dentist right away if your gums bleed during or after brushing your teeth. It's a sure sign that you're not doing well in your mouth.</p>
<p>
<strong>Clean your tongue and gums.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img class="myImage" title="Гигиена ротовой полости" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/1349634428_von-4.jpg" alt="Гигиена ротовой полости" />
<br>
Since it is not easy to find a special tongue cleaning scraper, use a regular teaspoon. Be very careful not to get disinfected like this.</p>
<p>
<strong>Update the dental fillings.</strong>
</p>
<p>If the seals wear out and wobble, they will accumulate leftovers. And so, anaerobic bacteria won't wait.<br>
<strong>
<br>
Don't eat onions and garlic.</strong>
</p>
<p>And don't overuse spicy sauces. Reduce coffee and alcohol consumption as they dehumidify the mouth. Lack of saliva causes an unpleasant odor. Note also that many popular mouthwash products are alcohol-based and instead of &quot;fresh, clean breath&quot; can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>
<strong>Don't smoke. You know why.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img class="myImage" title="Гнилые зубы" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/kurenie/

img/1349634445_von-6.jpg" alt="Гнилые зубы" />
<br>
<strong>Use a brush and thread more often.</strong>
</p>
<p>Don't forget to brush your teeth at least twice a day for three minutes. It's toothbrushing that should be your last thing before going to bed. Or the penultimate.</p>
<p>Specialists recommend patients to use Rembrandt paste, which contains carbamide pyroxide. This substance releases a significant amount of oxygen during tooth brushing, and it in turn kills anaerobic bacteria, a source of an unpleasant odor. And don't forget about the space between your teeth - bacteria love to settle there. Cleaning is simple: Wind 20 cm wax thread on the thumbs of both hands and gently insert the thread between the teeth. Three or four not very sharp forward-backward movements - and ready!</p>
<p>All sorts of mint-based &quot;facilitators of understanding&quot; are endlessly advertised on television. Do not poke on this rod - any gum refreshes your breath for thirty to forty minutes at most. Brushing your teeth is more effective, and most importantly more useful, and - there will be no smell from your mouth.</p>
