A painful craving for drug use - drug addiction - is the scourge of modern society. The rate of growth of this disease is horrifying, and the statistics of mortality from drug addiction exceed any existing disease. Many lives have been taken by the disease. It's a path to crime and prison, to death and despair. Drug addiction is sweeping the world of teenagers and is getting younger every year. Drug abuse among children is also a common phenomenon today. Parents who use drugs themselves make their children drug addicts. Our future, our hopes are in the hands of people dependent on chemicals. There are many types of addiction, but addiction to drugs is very complex. Drug captivity holds not only the body, but also the psyche of the person. For the next dose of the drug, addicts will go to robbery, deception or even murder. </p>
<br><br>
<h2>Stages of drug addiction </h2>
<p>In the first stage, mental dependence develops. It develops after people use it for the first time. After 1-2 months, addiction moves to physical (second stage). After 6 months of regular drug use, the third stage occurs, such people are already dangerous to society. They do not control their actions and act solely for the purpose of extracting narcotic substances. <em>Addiction among teenagers goes through all three stages even faster and turns people into real zombies</em>. </p>
<h2>Causes of drug addiction </h2>
<img class="fig" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/narkomaniya/pict/411.jpg" alt="Причины наркомании ">
<p>There are quite a few of them. Social conditions and parental inattention are the main causes of drug abuse, but each case is different. </p>
<h3>So, among the main causes of drug addiction can be distinguished: </h3>
<ul class="level-0">
<li class="lhead">/ <span class="lcount">z pages</span></li>
<li class="lpage">✔ Internal problems (troubles, social inequality, misunderstanding in the family),</li>
<li class="lpage">✔ Curiosity (many think that it is fashionable, or at least once in your life you need to try everything), </li>
<li class="lpage">✔ Search for new sensations, </li>
<li class="lpage">✔ Example of friends, </li>
<li class="lpage">✔ Protest against the circumstances, </li>
<li class="lpage">✔ Desire to assert yourself and appear to be older, </li>
<li class="lpage">✔ Availability of drug purchase. </li>
</ul>
<p>These factors, taken together and individually, make it possible for a disease such as drug addiction to spread rapidly and destroy societies. </p><br><br>
<h2>Treatment of drug addiction </h2>
<img class="fig" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/narkomaniya/pict/35.jpg" alt="Лечение наркомании ">
<p>Millions of people go to specialized clinics every year to seek treatment for drug abuse. In many cases, it is not just detoxification of the body that is required, but long-term treatment and recovery. In some cases, treatment for drug abuse has worked, but in most cases it is a relapse. Only billboards and advertisements guarantee a positive result. In practice, however, a small percentage of the total number of drug abusers is treatable, especially if treatment is initiated late in the course of the disease. There are many techniques available to help people get rid of their drug addiction. These include psychotherapy, hypnosis, coding, and drug treatment. Drug treatment may be given anonymously or in groups. They all differ in terms of both efficiency and cost. In any case, whatever method is chosen, treatment of drug addiction should be trusted to professionals. People who promise not to use drugs after another injection can't be trusted. The law even provides for compulsory drug treatment. <br />
	      Of course, drug addiction is difficult to fight, but it must be fought! Under no circumstances should one give up and leave a person to his or her own fate. In such a situation our relatives may find themselves, the indifference of society will ruin them. Fighting drug addiction is the duty of every inhabitant of the planet. And we need to start with prevention. </p>
<h2>Drug abuse prevention </h2>
<p>As already mentioned, the only way to eradicate drug addiction is through effective prevention. Preventive measures should be carried out both individually in each family and in society. Parents need to carefully monitor children and their environment, to prevent communication of the child with suspicious personalities, to protect from the negative influence of the street. It is necessary to correctly distribute the mode of the day in such a way that the child's body was not overloaded and, at the same time, the child was interested in something to do, and not to wander off without business. It is from idleness that the lion's share of adolescents become drug addicts. In general, adolescents automatically fall into the risk group, often the transitional age completely changes the person, it is these moments that can be a reference point for drug addiction. <br />
Day of the fight against drug addiction. <br />
		      Audio addiction has recently become widespread. This is the effect of binaural rhythms, simulating the effect of certain drugs. This technique was developed for the purpose of prevention, so that everyone who is interested in the effect of the drug without actually using it, could assess their feelings and in the future refuse to use drugs. But contrary to expectations, such a program had the opposite effect, and many healthy people, having listened to the audio files, decided to try real drugs. <br />
	        There is also symptomatic prevention of drug addiction. Such measures are effective for people who have experience with drug use but who are not considered to be addicts clinically. </p>
<h2>Rehabilitation of drug addicts </h2>
<p>Rehabilitation, a preventive measure, requires particular attention. Helping a former drug addict become a full-fledged part of society, giving a chance to correct the situation, finding a key to the joys of everyday life - these are the main tasks of rehabilitation. The stages of psychological, psychiatric and social assistance, occupational therapy and religious canons are applied consistently. If there was an anonymous drug treatment, every measure was taken to ensure that the patient's information did not cross the walls of the institution after the course of treatment. <br />
	      Traditional methods of rehabilitation are designed to return a person to society, to restore his social status. Religious - on the contrary, aimed at the withdrawal of a person from the social environment, his privacy and self-knowledge. Such methods will be effective only for those people who do not want to return to a social way of life. </p>
<h2>Consequences of drug addiction </h2>
<p>
<img class="fig" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/narkomaniya/pict/Narkomaniya-1.jpg" alt="Наркомания фото" title="Наркомания последствия">The consequences of drug abuse may not be thought about, may not be talked about, may not be noticed or felt, but exist. These are the conditions in which our children will have to live. What will our world be like in a few generations if we don't make sure that drug and substance abuse don't progress? <em>The effects of drug abuse will affect everyone, both those who spread drugs and those who use them, and those who are simply around</em>. <br />
		      Anyone who has been involved in the distribution of drugs but does not use them is at risk of experiencing the consequences through their own children. In the future, our children will build the same society we are building today. And drug addiction among young people can lead to the complete degradation of society as a whole, not only of the individual. <br />
		      People who are surrounded by drug addicts but are not drug addicts risk being dragged into this death swamp. <br />
		      Finally, addicts themselves cause irreparable harm to their health. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the harms of drug abuse. The most affected is the unborn child. Numerous pathologies and malformations, anomalies and mutations are the price of the next dose. If a child is born healthy in a drug-addicted environment, he or she will eventually become a drug addict. <br />
	      Even people who are not addicted to drugs feel the effects of drug abuse. This is the common pain of humanity. In many countries, this is problem #1. It is funded enormously, but everyone decides their own destiny. The problem of drug addiction affects everyone. As long as there are indifferent people in society, this problem cannot be eradicated. Only by working together can the war be won. Act! Don't be silent! Look around, maybe someone needs your help right now. Protect your loved ones from the fatal error, do not let step on the slippery path of death. Only a cohesive, strong society can stand against drug abuse. Don't be indifferent, indifference ruins people. Fight, and overcome this terrible disease.</p>
<h2>Drug breakage </h2>
<img class="fig" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/narkomaniya/pict/lomka-1.jpg" alt="ломка наркомана">
<p>Probably, every modern person gets at least occasionally to hear about such a terrible phenomenon as breaking a drug addict. Fortunately, most people are familiar with this horrible phenomenon only from books, films, or newspapers. It's much worse if there are people among your friends and relatives who have experienced this on their own. However, many people vaguely know what a <em>breakage</em> is. This is a serious oversight.</p>
<h2>Breaking - what is it?</h2>
<p>Indeed, it will be useful for everyone to know what a <em>breakage</em> is, to be able to quickly identify it if necessary and not to confuse it with other attacks. The official name for withdrawal is withdrawal syndrome. However, other nicknames given by the addicts themselves are much better known - kumar, harevo, dolbeschka and many others. Indeed, many drug users who have survived the bust are so afraid of a repetition that they prefer not even to call it an official or a known name.<br />
What is the mechanism of breaking? It's quite simple. First of all, it is worth saying that the pain of withdrawal is nothing but the usual body defense mechanism (as well as the headache of a hangover). That is, the body is well aware that it was injected with the most dangerous poison. Drugs quickly destroy the human body, but the person, experiencing the &quot;arrival&quot; and for a while after it just does not feel pain - some brain receptors are turned off. And if you take <em>drugs</em> regularly<em>, the breakdown</em> will not come - the mind will be constantly conceived and will not be able to respond adequately to the destruction. However, some time passes. The body is gradually cleaned of poison, and the owner does not add another portion (either by deciding to knit, or, which is much more common, because there is no drugs or money to buy them) and the mind begins to function. Perfectly aware of the consequences of taking drugs, the mind punishes its master with pain. This is the most primitive method to protect a person from destruction. The simplest example is to stick your finger in the fire. Does it hurt? But the hand immediately pulls back and the finger does not have time to be seriously burned. If it wasn't for pain, he'd just be charred. So don’t blame the pain - it protects us from more serious damage.</p>

<h2>Drug user's feelings of breakdown</h2>

<img class="fig" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/narkomaniya/pict/43.jpg" alt="Ощущения наркомана при ломке">

<p>Of course, speaking about such topics as <em>drug withdrawal,</em> it is worth talking not only about the mechanism, but also about how a drug addict feels when he is hit by a wave of withdrawal.<br />
		      At the first stages, the addict simply feels a slight malaise - chills, lethargy, a deterioration in mood and a sharp increase in sweating. As a result, the addict tries to put on as much clothes as possible, turn on all the heating devices, climb under the blanket with his head and just hide there from all over the world. At such moments, it is not necessary to approach a drug addict - it is really dangerous for any person - now the drug addict is no longer a reasonable person and practically unable to account for his actions. Hitting someone close to you is not difficult for him. At this stage, the drug effect wears out and the mind begins to take full effect.<br />
		      The next step is to try to cleanse the body more quickly. That is, frequent loose stools, nausea, and vomiting begin. However, in some cases, addicts feel so unwell and so apathetic that they are unable to find the strength or the need to leave their shelter - all of which they can easily do while lying on their beds, under a warm blanket. It is quite understandable that this spectacle does not look very decent.<br />
		      And the worst begins at the next stage. After all, the term &quot;breaking&quot; comes from the verb &quot;breaking&quot;. And indeed, it seems to the addict that someone is trying to break his body. First of all, there is terrible pain in the joints - as if someone is trying to turn them into an unnatural position. Almost immediately, the terrible pain in the muscles begins to be felt. Now the addict can't lie still. He just rolls on the floor or on the bed, often trying to hit the surrounding objects - so they think they can relieve the general pain. Of course, they don’t really feel that much of it - the pain of withdrawal is too great. But later, if the addict can survive the fracture, the body will remind him of all these blows received in semi-consciousness.<br />
		      By the way, the clarification about &quot;survive the break&quot; is not accidental. It often happens that drug addicts simply do not survive it. After all, withdrawal from addicts is always accompanied by a huge burden on the heart. And in some cases, it just doesn't hold up, and the result is that someone who wasn't that long ago is just dying in puddles of vomit and diarrhea. <br />
		      However, even if the body is still strong enough and the heart can withstand a breakdown, it is not a fact that this test will endure the person himself. After all, in breakout attacks, many find the simplest way out - suicide. A jump into a window, a loop, or cut veins. So it is no surprise that many people, even those who are serious about getting rid of their drug addiction, do not experience the first breakdown.<br />
		      Of course, the withdrawal effect increases markedly as the addict is &quot;pulled in.&quot; That is, a junkie with a long experience experiences more pain than a &quot;beginner&quot;. The fact is that the body is already poisoned and almost turned into a coward - many organs are practically non-functional.<br />
		      During withdrawal, the addict can think of nothing but pain. So no one should approach him. If he had to go to a loved one's murder to get the money for the dose, he would hardly think. It doesn't matter who it is - wife, mother or child. <br />
	      In addition, paranoid hallucinations often accompany withdrawal. In this state, a drug addict may well kill his parents, believing that they are the demons who came for his soul.</p>
<img class="fig" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/narkomaniya/pict/lomka-2.jpg" alt="Ломка у наркомана">
			<h2>How the fracture develops</h2>
<p>It should be noted that the <em>breakdown of codeine</em> addicts and, for example, hashish addicts varies considerably. That is, dependence on light drugs does not occur immediately. <br />
		      According to experts, if a drug addict is fond of hashish and other similar drugs, addiction occurs in 3-4 months. <em>Breakage after desomorphine</em> can develop when you use a drug for a month or two (read about the most common pharmacy drug - desomorphine). And if we talk about more serious types of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and similar, then a few techniques are enough to permanently erase the addict from the list of people. Cocaine withdrawal is considered one of the most dangerous and painful. It is quite understandable that even if he survives the breakdown, he will never be able to become a full-fledged person - getting rid of physical dependence is only the first and only possible step. However, psychological dependence persists for life. An &quot;ex&quot; drug addict can live 10-15 years without drugs, but when faced with a serious problem, he can break off and get back on drugs. And everything will go according to the new way. With the only difference is that now the body will be weakened by previous attacks.<br />
		      By the way, it is worth noting that the breakdown lasts for several hours, as some people think. In fact, breakdowns can last up to a week, or even two, for drug users. At this time, the different stages of the breakage alternate, but no longer leave their carrier. In the end, he will either survive and get the opportunity to live a semblance of life (a full-fledged member of society and a reliable friend, spouse, father, addict will never be again), or simply die, not enduring the unhuman pain.<br />
	      So there's only one really reliable way to never know all the horrors of withdrawal - just not to touch drugs. Remember, it's a one-way ticket. You're not gonna make it to the intermediate station. Look around - what is more attractive for you, a whole life lived by a healthy and strong person or death in a pool of your own excrement? This choice cannot be made for you. Only YOU can do it!</p>
