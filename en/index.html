Illegal <b>drug</b> use in the world is a <b>shocking fact</b> for many years. Not only do adults use and abuse drugs, but many adolescents and young people do. Illicit drugs such as <b>cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, LSD</b> and others are particularly dangerous because they can contain chemicals or toxins that, when mixed with other substances, can have fatal consequences.
<br>
For example<b>, ecstasy</b> is often mixed with various substances such as LSD, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, heroin, rat poison, caffeine, deworming dogs, etc. Its use is illegal, highly addictive, and incredibly dangerous.
<br>
Our society doesn't complain too much about <b>drug addicts</b>. Even in the context of death, the term is used as a deeply derogatory label in tabloid headlines. Opinion polls show that most people regard them as dangerous, unpredictable, and, crucially, self-inflicted. And it is this latter dimension that appears to be the key to the extreme stigma associated with drug abuse.

Women are also more likely to develop substance use disorders than men who use the same amounts.
<br>
Studies have shown that men are more likely to be subjected to peer pressure at the beginning of the drug abuse process, while women are more likely to engage in self-<b>medication</b>. <br>Many women without access to medical or psychiatric treatment, <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/narkomaniya/zhenshiny-narkomanki.html" target="_self"><b>Read more...</b></a>

Painful attraction to drug use - drug addiction - is a scourge of modern society. The growth rate of this disease is terrible, and the statistics of mortality from drug addiction exceeds any existing disease. Many lives have been taken by the disease. It's a path to crime and prison, to death and despair. Drug addiction is sweeping the world of teenagers and is getting younger every year. Drug abuse among children is also a common phenomenon today. Parents who use drugs themselves make their children drug addicts.

You feel sick, horrible, anxious and irritable without a drug. You no longer have the good feelings you had when you first took the drug. This is true if you use illegal drugs or if you abuse prescription drugs. Abuse involves taking a drug different from what your doctor told you (taking more or crushing tablets to &quot;inject&quot; or breathe in), taking someone else's prescription, or taking it just to &quot;kaifang.&quot; <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/narkomaniya/fakty-ob-upotreblenii-narkotikov.html" target="_self"><b>Learn more...</b></a>

It is not uncommon for a purulent abscess to form in the brain of a drug addict. It takes only five injections to literally start to rot the limbs. The addict's veins quickly deteriorate and he is forced to pound elsewhere, contributing to the spread of necrosis and infection. Very quickly, addicts lose their ability to move around and end up in the hospital.

Open a beer or pour yourself a glass of wine on the sofa in front of the TV - this is not something to be ashamed of and from this you will not become a cruel drunk. For many of us, spending time alone gives us the opportunity to relax and recharge before the next day or to relax after a long working week. While many people indulge in this simple pleasure from time to time, for others drinking alone is not that easy. Being a disease that thrives in isolation and loneliness, addiction can quickly take hold of you if you drink alone to cope with unpleasant emotions or trauma of the past. <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/alkogolizm/zhestokoe-pyanstvo.html"><b>Learn more...</b></a>

Alcohol dependence refers to diseases characterized by an increase in symptoms (relates to progressive diseases), which is characterized by a pathological attraction to alcohol, the development of withdrawal (hangover) syndrome when stopping alcohol consumption, and subsequently the development of persistent disorders of the nervous and mental systems and deterioration of the general medical condition. Subsequent use of alcohol is associated with the mental deterioration of the alcohol. <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/alkogolizm/alkogolnaya-zavisimost.html"><b>Learn more...</b></a>

In the early stages of alcoholism, a person may look normal and even happy. Only he feels some strange, but really very scary changes. The first symptoms of alcoholism are a lack of alcohol. An aspiring alcoholic feels uncomfortable if he does not have at least a few shots of alcohol in his hands or stomach. Of course, he goes to work, cleans houses, and even plays with children. But inside, emptiness is formed, despondency and depression attack. Just the thought that soon it will be possible to pour in another portion of poison, gives them a certain revitalization <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/alkogolizm/simptomy-alkogolizma.html"><b>More...</b></a>

Alcohol intoxication (acute alcohol intoxication) is a symptom complex of mental, vegetative and neurological disorders caused by the psychotropic effect of alcoholic beverages.
<br>
What are the signs of mild alcohol intoxication?
<br><br>
Mild drunkenness is accompanied by a feeling of warmth, hyperemia of the skin, a rapid pulse, increased appetite. Mood increases, feelings of cheerfulness and satisfaction develop, feelings of mental comfort develop, people feel a desire to speak, they strive for activity, speech becomes louder, and movements become more impulsive and sweeping.

Dose in 1.2 ppm (2.5 liters of beer or 400 ml of vodka), usually leads to complete loss of ability. A blood content of 4 - 5 ppm is officially considered fatal. 
<p>Alcohol is eliminated from the body very slowly: the rate of decomposition of alcohol in the blood in men is 0.10 - 0.15 ppm per hour, and in women - 0.085 - 0.10 ppm, and this process cannot be accelerated. After drinking a bottle of vodka, sobriety can only threaten you after 18 - 20 hours. <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/alkogolizm/tablica-vyvoda-alko.html"><b>Learn more...</b></a>

Perhaps, anyone who has at least once in his life got over alcohol, knows perfectly well what alcohol intoxication is. In this condition, reaction and coordination of movements deteriorate significantly. Many decisions made in such a state simply cannot be the decisions of a reasonable person. Of course, time spent under the influence of alcohol is not at all forgotten - most people forget about everything that happened. In addition, the person can hardly control himself, losing many human qualities. <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/alkogolizm/uskorit-vyvod-alkogolya.html"><b>Learn more...</b></a>

often demonstrate a number of noticeable behavioral changes. Initially, they may exhibit increased sociability, increased talkativeness, and relaxed behavior. As the intoxication progresses, coordination and balance may become impaired, resulting in stumbling or clumsiness. Slurred speech, poor judgment, and difficulty concentrating or remembering are also common signs of intoxication.

At first, I only drank a glass or two a day. However, it soon became a bottle per day. Then there was a big binge. Most days I drank just enough to self-medicate. <a href="https://drugsnoru.github.io/studies.github.io/en/alkogolizm/alkash-plachetsya-v-zhiletku.html"><b>Learn more...</b></a>

<h3><i>Quotes about addiction, alcoholism and recovery</i></h3>
<img class="fig" src="http://drugsno.w10.site/narkomaniya/img/citaty.jpg" alt="Quotes about addiction, alcoholism and recovery">
&quot;The priority of any <b>drug addict</b> is to drown out the pain of life in order to relieve the day with some kind of shopping relief.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;The initial path to <b>sobriety</b> is a delicate balance between understanding one’s desire to escape and refraining from dependence.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;<b>Drugs</b> are a waste of time. They destroy your memory, your self-esteem, and everything that is connected to your self-esteem.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;First you <b>drink</b>, then you drink, then you drink.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Never underestimate a <b>recovering addict</b>. We fight for our lives every day in ways that most people will never understand.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I have absolutely no pleasure in the <b>stimulants</b> that I sometimes indulge so insanely. Not in pursuit of pleasure, I risked my life, my reputation, and my mind. It was a desperate attempt to escape painful memories, unbearable loneliness and fear of some strange impending doom&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;<b>Addictions</b> ... began as magical pets, pocket monsters. They did extraordinary tricks, showed you things you didn't see, and were fun. But they have come, through some sort of gradual, terrible alchemy, to make decisions for you. After all, they made your most important life decisions. And they were ... less intelligent than goldfish.&quot;
